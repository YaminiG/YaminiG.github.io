My name is Yamini and I'm a Software Engineer based out of Raleigh, NC. I really enjoy problem solving, building (and inevitably breaking) stuff and screaming at code. My mother would be testament to the fact that that fixes neither children nor code. In whatever little time I have left, I love reading, writing and impressing my peers with an off-key version of Riptide on my ukulele. 

I graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering. Since my background has been mainly in embedded systems and Electrical Engineering, I have worked on a variety of projects that have helped me utilize and hone my coding skills. From building a Gaussian de-noiser using MATLAB to a coin-based cellphone charging station (with a gaming console and jukebox) on Raspberry Pi, I have developed a holistic understanding of how software interacts with hardware. I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Microcontroller Interfacing at Virginia Tech for three semesters which furthered my interest in programming- soon after I was building AR apps and doing research projects on increasing the computational efficiency of deep neural networks! You can find more of my work in the Portfolio section.
